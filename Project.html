        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <p>Technology encompasses the tools, systems, and innovations created to solve problems, enhance productivity, or improve
        lives. It covers everything from simple tools like the wheel to advanced fields like artificial intelligence. Hereâ€™s a
        brief breakdown of various areas in technology:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Information Technology (IT)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Involves using computers and software to manage data and information. Key elements include hardware (computers,
                    servers), software (applications, operating systems), networking, and cybersecurity.
                    IT plays a huge role in almost every industry, facilitating communication, data management, and operations through
                    systems like databases, cloud computing, and enterprise software.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)
                <ul>
                    <li>AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks like speech recognition,
                    decision-making, and language translation.</li>
                    <li>Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time
                    without explicit programming.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Robotics and Automation
                <ul>
                    <li>Robotics involves creating machines that can perform tasks traditionally done by humans, often used in manufacturing,
                    healthcare, and space exploration.</li>
                    <li>Automation uses technology to perform repetitive tasks with minimal human intervention, increasing efficiency and
                    consistency in industries.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
